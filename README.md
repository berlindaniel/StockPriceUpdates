# StockPriceUpdates
A program that I am using to find real-time prices for select indices in milliseconds. Since I have to keep an excel market journal for an Econ class this semester, I just run this program after the market closes.

Currently working on integrating this data into my excel spreadsheet (See ExcelFileUpdate), which will make the process fully-functional.
