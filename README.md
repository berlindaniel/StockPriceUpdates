# StockPriceUpdates
A program that I am using to track real-time prices for select indices. Since I have to keep an excel market journal for an Econ class this semester, I just run this program after the market closes. This is far superior to the laborious alternative of searching every ticker online, copying and pasting, etc.

Currently working on a procedure to integrate these data into my excel spreadsheet (see ExcelFileUpdate), which will make the process fully-functional.
